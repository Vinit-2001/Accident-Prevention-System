# Accident-Prevention-System
Follow these simple steps to watch out our simulation results,
1. Open Proteuos simulation folder
2. Open Simulation.pdsprj using proteus software to view the schematic
diagram.
3. Double click on PIC16F877 device and add
Mini_Project.X.production.hex in the program file section and set 
Processor Clock Frequency to 12Mhz.
4. Double click on the MQ-3 sensor library and add GasSensorTEP.HEX in 
the program file section.
5. Double click on the Infrared obstacle sensor library and add 
InfraredSensorsTEP.HEX in the program file section.
6. Run the simulation you will observe the results accordingly.
Thank you!!
